# Axon Sales Data Management and Analysis

## Problem Statement

A small company, Axon, is a retailer specializing in selling classic cars. However, they are facing challenges in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data, and the lack of a centralized system hampers effective data management and analysis. The management is unable to access accurate and up-to-date sales reports, impacting their decision-making process.

To address these issues, Axon has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) solution using Microsoft Power BI and SQL. The goal of this capstone project is to design and implement a BI solution that will enable Axon to effectively manage and analyze their sales data. The solution should provide the following capabilities:

1. Import and integrate data from their MySQL database into Power BI.
2. Clean and transform the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.
3. Build interactive dashboards and reports using Power BI, facilitating data understanding for the sales team and management.
4. Utilize SQL for advanced analytics and extracting insights to improve sales performance, if required.
5. Enable real-time access to dashboards and reports, empowering the management to make data-driven decisions.
6. Ensure the solution is user-friendly and intuitive for both the sales team and management.

The success of this project will be measured by the extent to which it helps Axon effectively manage and analyze their sales data, leading to improved decision-making processes.

## Solution Overview

The proposed solution involves the following steps:

1. Data Integration: Import and integrate data from Axon's MySQL database into Power BI. Establish a connection to the database and retrieve the relevant sales data.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation: Apply necessary data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure the data is accurate and formatted correctly for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, standardizing data types, and creating calculated columns or measures as required.

3. Dashboard and Report Development: Utilize Power BI's capabilities to build interactive dashboards and reports. Design visualizations that provide meaningful insights into sales performance, such as sales trends, top-selling products, regional analysis, and customer segmentation.

4. Advanced Analytics with SQL: Utilize SQL queries to perform advanced analytics on the sales data, if necessary. This may involve calculating key metrics, conducting cohort analysis, or identifying patterns and trends within the data.

5. Real-time Access and Collaboration: Publish the dashboards and reports to a Power BI service or server, enabling real-time access for the management team. Implement appropriate security measures to ensure data privacy and access control. Enable collaboration and sharing features to foster effective communication and decision-making.

6. User Training and Support: Provide training sessions to the sales team and management on how to effectively use the Power BI solution. Offer ongoing support and assistance to address any questions or issues that may arise during usage.

## Project Success Criteria

The success of this capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. Effective Data Management: The solution should enable Axon to manage their sales data efficiently, ensuring data integrity, accuracy, and accessibility.

2. Improved Data Analysis: The dashboards, reports, and analytics provided by the solution should facilitate better understanding and analysis of sales data, enabling insights-driven decision-making.

3. Enhanced Decision-Making: The solution should contribute to improved decision-making processes within Axon, leading to better sales strategies, enhanced customer experiences, and increased revenue.

By addressing the challenges in sales data management and analysis, this capstone project aims to empower Axon with the tools and insights necessary to thrive in the competitive classic car retail
